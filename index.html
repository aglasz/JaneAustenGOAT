      Currency, replacing Charles Darwin on the 10 Pound Note as of 2017.

      <br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is believed to be the first of the
      'Enemy-to-Lovers' trope that is now very popular in the literary world.

      <br /><br />Jane is buried in Winchester Cathedral, one of the largest
      Cathedral's in Europe. It isn't clear what Austen died of at the age of
      41, some believe cancer, others a rare disease, others even believe she
      was poisoned. <br /><img

      It is a truth universally acknowledged that a reader in possession of good
      taste, must love Jane Austen. <br />

            One would be hard pressed to find another female author whose work
            has had such a major impact on literature or screen entertainment to
            date. Countless authors have taken inspiration from Austen's works
            and made them their own. She was the first to write a novel about
            ordinary people living their day to day life. Her works have been
            reworked in fantasy, mystery, romance, anime...essentially if
            there's a genre out there there's likely to be work inspired by
            Austen available.

            In addition to literary works inspired by Jane Austen, there has
            been a multitude of screen adaptations of her books, stories
            inspired by her books, and the story of Jane Austen herself. These
            movies and shows help keep the characters alive in our imaginations
            and hearts. Bringing Jane Austen's work to the screen helps
            introduce many people to her that may never have thought to pick up
            her books before.

      <p class="books">
        Not only are Austen's books a work of art, but they can also teach the
        reader some valuable life lessons if the reader pays attention. There is
        a book called <b><i>A Jane Austen Education</i></b> by William
        Deresiewicz, that I highly recommend to any Jane Austen fan who wants a
        deeper dive into the phycology or her books. Here is what the back cover
        has to say: <br /><br /><b>Emma</b> <br /><i
          >Pay attention to the everyday things-</i
        >
        those little things that happen hour by hour to the people in your life:
        what your nephew said, what your friend heard, what your neighbor did.
        That is what the fabric of our years really consists of. That is what
        life is really about. <br /><br />~ <br /><br /><b
          >Pride and Prejudice</b
        >
        <br /><i>You aren't born perfect.</i> You are born with a whole novel's
        worth of errors ahead of you. But making mistakes is the only way to
        grow up. Being right might get you a pat on the head, but being wrong
        can help you find out who you really are. <br /><br />~ <br /><br /><b
          >Northanger Abbey</b
        >
        <br /><i>Stay awake; don't take things for granted.</i> By renouncing
        certainty and cynicism, by opening yourself to new experiences, you can
        turn your life into an adventure that will never end. <br /><br />~
        <br /><br /><b>Mansfield Park</b> <br /><i
          >Being entertained is not the same as being happy.</i
        >
        Perpetual amusement leads only to the perpetual threat of boredom. The
        keys to true happiness lie elsewhere. <br /><br />~ <br /><br /><b
          >Persuasion</b
        >
        <br /><i>Be honest with your friends.</i> Unconditional acceptance is
        not real friendship. A true friend wants you to be happy, but being
        happy and felling good about yourself are not the same thing. A true
        friend points out your mistakes- even at the risk of losing your
        friendship. <br /><br />~ <br /><br /><b>Sense and Sensibility</b>
        <br /><i>Love is about growing up, not staying young.</i> It means a
        never-ending clash of opinions and perspectives. A true lover is someone
        who is different from you and willing to challenge you. If your lover is
        already just like you, then neither one of you has anywhere to go.
