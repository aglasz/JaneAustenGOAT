        It is a truth universally acknowledged that a reader in possession of good taste, must love Jane Austen. <br>

                    another female author whose work has had such a major impact on
                    literature or screen entertainment to date. Countless authors have
                    taken inspiration from Austen's works and made them their own. She was the first to
                     write a novel about ordinary people living their day to day life. Her works
                    have been reworked in fantasy, mystery, romance, anime...essentially if
                    there's a genre out there there's likely to be work inspired by Austen
                    available.

                    the characters alive in our imaginations and hearts. Bringing Jane Austen's work 
                    to the screen helps introduce many people to her that may never have thought to 
                    pick up her books before. </td>

      <p> Not only are Austen's books a work of art, but they can also teach the reader some valuable life lessons
         if the reader pays attention. There is a book called <b><i>A Jane Austen Education</i></b> by William Deresiewicz,
        that I highly recommend to any Jane Austen fan who wants a deeper dive into the phycology or her books. Here is what the back cover has to say:
        <br><br><b>Emma</b>
        <br><i>Pay attention to the everyday things-</i> those little things that happen hour by hour to the people in your life: what your nephew said, what your friend heard, what your neighbor did. That is what the fabric of our years really consists of. That is what life is really about.  
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br><b>Pride and Prejudice</b>
        <br><i>You aren't born perfect.</i> You are born with a whole novel's worth of errors ahead of you. But making mistakes is the only way to grow up. Being right might get you a pat on the head, but being wrong can help you find out who you really are.
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br><b>Northanger Abbey</b>
        <br><i>Stay awake; don't take things for granted.</i> By renouncing certainty and cynicism, by opening yourself to new experiences, you can turn your life into an adventure that will never end. 
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br><b>Mansfield Park</b>
        <br><i>Being entertained is not the same as being happy.</i> Perpetual amusement leads only to the perpetual threat of boredom. The keys to true happiness lie elsewhere. 
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br><b>Persuasion</b>
        <br><i>Be honest with your friends.</i> Unconditional acceptance is not real friendship. A true friend wants you to be happy, but being happy and felling good about yourself are not the same thing. A true friend points out your mistakes- even at the risk of losing your friendship.
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br><b>Sense and Sensibility</b>
        <br><i>Love is about growing up, not staying young.</i> It means a never-ending clash of opinions and perspectives. A true lover is someone who is different from you and willing to challenge you. If your lover is already just like you, then neither one of you has anywhere to go. 
        <br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
